Here’s an analysis of the main API functions used in the provided code, including the parameters and their purpose, with simple example explanations:

1. TriangleTrimHandler Class
trim(TriangleVertex & v)
Parameters: v (a vertex object of type TriangleVertex)
Purpose: Trims the adjacency list of the vertex v by removing any vertex IDs smaller than the current vertex ID (v.id). It then sorts the adjacency list.
Example:
TriangleVertex v;
v.id = 3;
v.value = {1, 2, 4, 5};
TrimHandler.trim(v);  // v.value becomes {4, 5}
2. TriangleAggregation Class (Aggregator)
init()

Purpose: Initializes the count and sum values to zero.
Example:
TriangleAggregation aggregator;
aggregator.init();  // count = 0, sum = 0
init_udf(size_t & prev)

Parameters: prev (previous global aggregation result, typically a global sum)
Purpose: Resets the sum to zero when starting a new aggregation round.
Example:
size_t prev = 10;
aggregator.init_udf(prev);  // sum = 0
aggregate_udf(size_t & task_count)

Parameters: task_count (the count of triangles from a task)
Purpose: Aggregates the local task count into the global count.
Example:
size_t task_count = 5;
aggregator.aggregate_udf(task_count);  // count += 5
stepFinal_udf(size_t & partial_count)

Parameters: partial_count (partial triangle count from a worker)
Purpose: Adds partial counts from other workers (except the master) to the sum.
Example:
size_t partial_count = 7;
aggregator.stepFinal_udf(partial_count);  // sum += 7
finishPartial_udf(size_t & collector)

Parameters: collector (variable to collect the partial aggregation result)
Purpose: Finishes the aggregation for the local worker and stores the count in the collector.
Example:
size_t collector;
aggregator.finishPartial_udf(collector);  // collector = count
finishFinal_udf(size_t & collector)

Parameters: collector (variable to collect the final aggregated result)
Purpose: Finalizes the aggregation by adding the master’s count to the sum and outputs the final triangle count.
Example:
size_t collector;
aggregator.finishFinal_udf(collector);  // collector = sum, prints "Triangle Count = 25"
3. TriangleWorkerNode Class (Computation)
task_spawn(VertexT * v)

Parameters: v (pointer to a vertex object)
Purpose: Spawns a task from the vertex v and adds it to the task queue. If the vertex has fewer than 2 neighbors, no task is spawned.
Example:
TriangleWorkerNode comper;
VertexT v;
v.id = 3;
v.value = {1, 2, 4};
comper.task_spawn(&v);  // Adds a task for vertex v
*triangle_count(vector<VertexT > & frontier, VertexID last)

Parameters:
frontier (vector of pointers to vertices in the current frontier)
last (the largest vertex ID in the triangle)
Purpose: Counts the number of triangles involving the vertices in the frontier and the last vertex last. A triangle is counted if there is a mutual neighbor between two vertices in the frontier.
Example:
vector<VertexT *> frontier = {&v1, &v2};
VertexID last = 5;
size_t count = comper.triangle_count(frontier, last);  // Returns the number of triangles
*compute(SubgraphT & g, ContextT & context, vector<VertexT > & frontier)

Parameters:
g (subgraph of vertices being processed)
context (vertex ID representing the largest vertex in the triangle)
frontier (list of neighboring vertices to check for triangle formation)
Purpose: Performs the computation for counting triangles in the subgraph, aggregates the local triangle count, and updates the global aggregator.
Example:
SubgraphT subgraph;
vector<VertexT *> frontier = {&v1, &v2};
ContextT context = 5;
comper.compute(subgraph, context, frontier);  // Aggregates the count for this computation
4. TriangleWorker Class (Worker)
toVertex(char line)*

Parameters: line (string line containing vertex data)
Purpose: Parses a line of data (usually from a file) and creates a TriangleVertex object from it. The line should contain the vertex ID followed by its neighbors.
Example
char line[] = "3 1 2 4 5";
TriangleWorker worker(4);
TriangleVertex* v = worker.toVertex(line);  // Creates a TriangleVertex with ID 3 and neighbors [1, 2, 4, 5]
task_spawn(VertexT * v, vector<TriangleTask> & tcollector)

Parameters:
v (pointer to a vertex object)
tcollector (vector of tasks to collect spawned tasks)
Purpose: Spawns a task for the given vertex v and adds it to the task collector.
Example
vector<TriangleTask> tcollector;
worker.task_spawn(&v1, tcollector);  // Spawns tasks for vertex v1 and adds to tcollector
5. Main Function
init_worker(&argc, &argv)

Purpose: Initializes the worker with the command-line arguments passed to the program.
Example:
init_worker(&argc, &argv);  // Initializes worker with the input arguments
worker.run(param)

Parameters: param (worker parameters including the input file path)
Purpose: Starts the worker to process the graph data and execute triangle counting.
Example:
WorkerParams param;
param.input_path = "graph_data.txt";
worker.run(param);  // Starts processing the graph data
